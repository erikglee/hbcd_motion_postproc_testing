Introduction
============

In the HBCD study, Axivity Ax6 sensors were used to record
infant leg movements across 72 continuous hours. One sensor
was placed on the distal right ankle and one sensor was
placed on the distal left ankle, using legwarmers with a pocket
to hold the sensor.
Sensors were set to start recording at 10 a.m. eastern / 9 a.m.
central / 8 a.m. mountain / 7 a.m. pacific. Caregivers were
instructred to go about their typical activities but to remove
the sensors if the baby went into water (e.g., bathtub or pool)
and replace them afterward.

The sensors were set to record accelerometer (acceleration,
range of +/- 16g) and gyroscope (angular velocity, rate of rotation,
+/- 2000 dps) data continuously at 25 samples per second. From this,
we can estimate how frequently and how vigorously an infant is
moving his or her legs, including an estimate of sedentary physical
activity, light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous activity,
or asleep.

Before the 72 hours of data were collected, a calibration file was
collected for each sensor. Instructions for collection of the calibration
data were: "There are 6 flat surfaces of the sensor and we want to record
data with the sensor sitting still on each of its flat surfaces.
To do this: place the sensor on a level, flat surface (e.g., the surface
of a desk or table). Wait 10 seconds. Rotate it so that it is resting
on its next flat surface. Wait 10 seconds. You should put the sensor in 6
different positions and collect 10 seconds of data in each position,
so just over a minute of data in total (including the time to rotate it).
It does not matter what order you do this in.
